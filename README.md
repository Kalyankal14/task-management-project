# Project Description: Task Management Application

#### Overview:
Develop a Task Management Application where users can create, update, delete, and categorize tasks. The application will use React for the frontend and Redux for state management.

#### Features:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement a simple login and registration system.
   - Users should be able to sign up, log in, and log out.

2. **Task Management:**
   - Users can create tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority level (e.g., low, medium, high).
   - Tasks can be marked as complete or incomplete.
   - Users can edit or delete tasks.

3. **Categorization:**
   - Users can categorize tasks into different projects or categories (e.g., Work, Personal, School).
   - Users can view tasks based on selected categories.

4. **Filtering and Sorting:**
   - Implement functionality to filter tasks based on their completion status or priority level.
   - Users can sort tasks by due date or priority.

5. **Notifications:**
   - Implement notifications to remind users of upcoming tasks or overdue tasks.

6. **User Interface:**
   - Develop a clean and responsive user interface using CSS or a UI library (e.g., Material-UI, TailwindCss).

7. **Redux Integration:**
   - Use Redux for state management to handle the application's data and user actions.
   - Implement actions, reducers, and store to manage the state of tasks, categories, and user authentication.

#### Learning Outcomes:
- Understanding of React components and lifecycle.
- Practical implementation of Redux for state management.
- User authentication and data management.
- UI/UX design principles and responsive design.

#### Stretch Goals:
- Implement data persistence using a backend server or local storage.
- Add the ability to collaborate with other users on tasks.
- Integrate a calendar view for tasks.
